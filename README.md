The following steps steps will get you started for the exercise sessions:

1. Clone / Download this repository
2. Install VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/
3. Install Docker Desktop: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/
4. Install the app Dev Containers in VSCode:
        Open the Extension Marketplace: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace
        Search and install Dev Containers
5. Start VSCode with the top folder of this repository as the root folder:
        A message should appear on the bottom right corner asking you to build the container.
        Alternatively, you can open the Command Palette of VSCode and type in “Dev Container: Rebuild and Reopen in Container.”.
        Click on it to start building the image and wait until the container runs. Depending on your computer and internet connection, the process can take several minutes.
        You can check that you are running the dev container by looking at the bottom left corner where a field should state “Dev Container: DevContainerFSSS”.
